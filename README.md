My inspiration for creating this project was a <strong>tutorial</strong> from <strong>JavaScript Mastery</strong> channel on Youtube:<br /> Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls<br />
Source: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_corona_tracker

### I made some useful changes:<br />
* <strong>I used those APIs for fetching the global and country specific data:</strong><br /> 
Global: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/daily <strong>(used in tutorial)</strong><br />
Country: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest <strong>(added by me)</strong><br />

* <strong>I have used a line chart instead of a bar chart for a country data visualization</strong>

### To run project:<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bekazandukeli/covid-19-tracker.git
cd covid-19-tracker
npm install
npm start
```

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:30aa) to view it in the browser.
