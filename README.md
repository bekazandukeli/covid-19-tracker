### I made some useful changes:<br />
* <strong>I used those APIs for fetching the global and country specific data:</strong><br /> 
Global: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/daily<br />
Country: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest<br />

* <strong>I have used a line chart instead of a bar chart for a country data visualization</strong>
