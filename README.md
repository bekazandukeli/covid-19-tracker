## Track COVID-19
### This application was created to track spreading of COVID-19.<br />

You can see the <strong>live version</strong> of this app here: https://bekazandukeli.github.io/covid-19-tracker/<br />

My inspiration for creating this project was a <strong>tutorial</strong> from <strong>JavaScript Mastery</strong> channel on Youtube:<br /> Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls<br />
Source: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_corona_tracker

### I made some useful changes:<br />
* <strong>I used those APIs for fetching the global and country specific data:</strong><br /> 
Global: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/daily <strong>(used in tutorial)</strong><br />
Country: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest <strong>(used by me)</strong><br />

* <strong>I created a line chart instead of a bar chart while specific country is chosen</strong>

### To run project:<br />

`git clone https://github.com/bekazandukeli/covid-19-tracker.git`<br />
`cd covid-19-tracker`<br />
`npm install`<br />
`npm start`<br />

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:30aa) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
